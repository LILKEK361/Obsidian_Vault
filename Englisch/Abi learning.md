1. Point out the authors views on white voters and the situation in the USA after Trump's presidency:

		The author splits the white voter into two groups. First the group that votes for Biden and second the group that votes for Trump. The author describes the Trump voters as people who openly except rasisim, police brutality and misoogynisitc. 
		
		In contrestat to that he describes the Biden voters as people who fight for the right thing, for equality of everyone and who stand against tear gas and rubber bullets.

		The author describes the America after Trump's presedency as a devided country. Where there are many people side by side with the blacks but there are also many people how are feeling the are supieror because they are white. 


2. Analyse the language and style the author uses to convince the readers of his views.


			The author firstly uses the prase "I now know" to show what he has learned during Trump's presedency. That kind of "learning" are we also seeing later in the text. It is used to convience the reader that Trump's presedency was like a school lesson. Then the author uses the following prase to show how unbelievible it is what Trump is doing and what he stands for: "I'm still trying to digest that side of White America"(l. 10). With that he also wants to show, what people are voting for Trump. After that he describes the things he has learnd during Trump's presedency as "lessons" that "I don't think I will ever forget"(l. 15). With that he also tries to show how bad Trump's presedency was and that it was like a school lesson for the USA. The author also uses a lot of quotes from Trump in his text to display his speech and his ideas (l. 25, 26, 28). With the quotes he tries to show how bad of a person Trump and his voters are. For example he uses the quote "shithole" to show Trumps racist side. To also show how bad Trump voters are he uses the author of White Rage in his article. The author of "White Rage" says that Trumps basicly hooks his voters on a drug ("White supramacy")(l.29-34). He now shows the read that the Trump voters are addictes how dont know what they are during because they are blinded by a "drug".
			
		After halfe of the article, the author switches the other way to show what was good during Trumps presedency. This is also a  stylistic and language wise a good choice. Now the reader has read a lot of bad things and is now ready to hear about the good things and is more open to good news and views. In this span of the article the author uses another famous persons to underline his views and to convince the viewer that there were also good things during Trump's presedency. He uses Harry Belafonte two show his views on the other side of White voters. Harry Belafonte says that they have now many white allies (l. 46). With that he shows the users that there are also people who fight against Trump and conviceses the reader that he also should get active.
